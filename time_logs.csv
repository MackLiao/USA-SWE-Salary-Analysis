WEEK,TASKS,TIME
Week 1,Selected dataset and came up with the questions that worth being answered via analyzing the dataset. Downloaded the dataset and set up folders on the PC. Set up coding environment and loaded necessary libraries.,"Aug 27, 8:30 pm - 10:28 pm"
,Browsed through the dataset and went through its documentation. Figured out the meaning of each column and wrote down the framework of the project that I planned to finish.,"Aug 30, 3:10 pm - 5:00 pm"
Week 2,Started basic R coding on the project. Preprocessed the input data by cleaning up NA value and removing imprecise data. ,"Sep 8, 9:47 pm - 11:20 pm"
,"Aggregated data by states to have a better visualization, and found out there were a few states were missed from the table.","Sep 10, 9:30 am - 11:00 am"
Week 3,"Finished the R code for the first visualization, which is composed of two histograms, showing the financial advantages of SWE compared with average job salaries. Changed the color of diagrams to improve the contrast.","Sep 13, 9:12 pm - 10:50 pm"
,Reread the official documentation of the dataset and rearranged it to a docx file.,"Sep 14, 8:21 am - 9:00 am"
,Prepared the in-class presentation of describing my dataset.,"Sep 17, 6:20 pm - 7:23 pm"
Week 4,Finished the visualization of a scatterplots diagram between HomePrice and Mean Salary. Noticed that there is a positive correlation between those two attributes.,"Sep 18, 2:20 pm - 2:54 pm"
,Finished the visualization of a bubble plot diagram which shows the relation between Rent and mean salary adjusted. Manipulated the color and the time period to improve the clarity and readability.,"Sep 19, 8:00 pm - 9:34 pm"
,Designed a primate structure of the shiny app. Played around with the shiny package.,"Sep 20, 3:12 pm - 3:53 pm"
Week 5,"In order to show the data in an interactive US map, the geographical data are required. Obtained and Joined the geographical data with the SWE salary data to faciliate the visualization.","Sep 30, 2:18 pm - 4:03 pm"
,"Visualized the data on the US map with each state highlighted. Implemented the feature that allows users to click each state to obtain the corresponding information. Implemented the filter feature, which enables users to filter states by max & min Mean salary and/or max & min Rent. The filtered states would be highlighted.","Oct 1, 7:06 pm - 9:25 pm"
Week 6,Shared the current progress on class and were inspired the direction that I could further improve.,"Oct 2, 8:00 am - 9:50 am"
,"Implemented the dashboard feature where users could select from US map visualization or line map visualization. Implemented the line map visualization where users can select two attributes from the dataset and the plot the dots, and the closest line would be indicated on the map as well to show the correlation. Implemented the color gradation feature raised by Oscar during the class where each state is colored differently based on the attribute the user selects from the dropdown table; the one with higher value has lighter color. Implement the sample filtering feature to faciliate users to understand how the filter works.","Oct 7, 3:30 pm - 11:50 pm"
